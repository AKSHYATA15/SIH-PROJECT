# SIH-PROJECT

This project is part of our Smart India Hackathon grand final prototype, which aims to enhance the authenticity verification of products displayed on e-commerce websites. The prototype implements a two-step verification process:

Logo Authenticity Check: The first step involves analyzing the brand's logo on the product and calculating a similarity score to determine whether the logo is genuine or counterfeit.

Product Image and Description Verification: The second step ensures that the product image matches the provided description, helping to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the product listing.
